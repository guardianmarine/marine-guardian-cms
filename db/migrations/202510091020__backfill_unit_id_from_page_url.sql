-- Migration: Backfill unit_id from page_url for existing buyer_requests
-- Description: Parse page_url to extract unit UUID and populate unit_id column

-- ============================================================================
-- BACKFILL BUYER_REQUESTS.UNIT_ID
-- ============================================================================

-- Update buyer_requests where unit_id is null but page_url contains a unit UUID
UPDATE public.buyer_requests br
SET unit_id = u.id
FROM public.units u
WHERE br.unit_id IS NULL
  AND br.page_url IS NOT NULL
  -- Match URLs like /unit/<uuid> or /inventory/<uuid>

  );

-- ============================================================================
-- BACKFILL LEADS.UNIT_ID FROM BUYER_REQUESTS
-- ============================================================================

-- Update leads where unit_id is null but the source buyer_request has a unit_id
-- This handles cases where leads were created before the unit_id mapping was added
UPDATE public.leads l
